# Aave Flash Loan Mix
This repo inspired by [brownie mix](https://github.com/brownie-mix/aave-flashloan-mix). Tests run in Ethereum mainnet-fork (Alchemy).

The purpose is to build arbitrage smart contract utilizing flash loans.

To do (basic):
- [x] Solve Kovan/Rinkeby issues (transactions reverted)
- [x] Add first tests
- [x] Add swaps to the contract (Uniswap V3)
- [ ] Add tests covering swaps
- [ ] Add interaction with the second DEX (Uniswap V2)
- [ ] Add tests covering all swap logic


To do (advanced):
- [ ] Add custom arbitrage logic (regardless potential profits/losses)
- [ ] Add price feeds (?)
- [ ] Add routes (?)
