# Flash loan + Uniswap V2/V3
This repo inspired by [brownie mix](https://github.com/brownie-mix/aave-flashloan-mix). Tests run in Ethereum mainnet-fork (Alchemy).

The purpose is to build arbitrage smart contract utilizing flash loans.

To run flash loan in kovan testnet, follow the next steps (your test wallet must have at least 0.011 ETH, however you can update min balance in scripts):
1. Update .env file with your credentials (PRIVATE_KEY, WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID, WEB3_ALCHEMY_PROJECT_ID, etc.).
'''
export PRIVATE_KEY=56b44efdb532...
export BAD_ACTOR=46b44efdb532...
export WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID=g5bc2a9d4a..
export WEB3_ALCHEMY_PROJECT_ID=GHJT355...
export ETHERSCAN_TOKEN=6FGRH...
'''
2. Run 'brownie compile' to check if the contract compiles.
3. Run 'brownie run scripts/run_flashloan.py'.
